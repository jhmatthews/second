\begin{abstract} 
Broad absorption lines (BALs) in the ultraviolet 
are seen in $\sim20\%$ of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and 
are also prominent in spectra of cataclysmic variables (CVs)
and some X-ray binaries. Blue-shifted BALs are the most direct evidence of 
accretion disk `winds' in such systems; mass loaded outflows
emanating from the disk that may be driven by line forces or
magnetic processes. Here, I present an eighteen-month transfer report
on a PhD project that involves using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
capable of modeling a variety of systems. The aim is to both
help inform our understanding of the profound connection between 
accretion and mass loss processes, and to test unification models in 
QSOs, CVs and X-ray binaries. 
The code produces synthetic spectra for different viewing angles in
a biconical disk wind model by passing photons through a wind geometry
with a self-consistently computed temperature and ionization structure.
In addition to presenting some relevant background and results so far,
I give an outline of projects and timescales for the remaining work
that will contribute to the final thesis.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
Outflows are crucial to our understanding of accreting systems and are close to ubiquitous 
across approximately 10 orders of magnitude in mass. These outflows can take the form of 
highly collimated radio jets \citep{bellonijet2010}, but can also manifest as 
more mass-loaded `winds' emanating from the accretion disk. The most spectacular evidence of
disk winds is blue-shifted broad absorption lines (BALs), a phenonomenon observed in 
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs; Turner \& Miller 2009, 
Weymann et al. 1991\nocite{turnermiller2009, weymann1991}), cataclysmic variables 
(CVs; Cordova \& Mason 1982\nocite{cordova1982}) and X-ray binaries \citep{ioannau2003}.

It is therefore clear that outflows present a unique opportunity to probe the 
proposed {\sl universality} \citep[e.g.][]{mchardy2006, SKUK2012} of the accretion process across the mass scale, whilst also 
providing potential {\sl unification} models (e.g. Elvis 2000\nocite{elvis2000}) for each class of object. 
Despite this, the full effect of a disk wind on the observational appearance of an accreting system
remains unclear, and even the fundamental theoretical questions relating to the origin and driving mechanism
for mass loss are unsolved (see Proga 2000 and Proga 2010 for two theoretical reviews). 
These problems affect a variety of astrophysical phenonena. 
Disk winds provide a possible source of AGN feedback, which is a crucial component in galaxy formation and evolution models (e.g. Silk \& Rees 1998\nocite{silkrees1998}).
Cataclysmic variables are one possible progenitor for Type Ia Supernovae, standardisable candles
used to predict the accelerating expansion of the universe, and so the role of accretion in the evolution
of these systems must be understood. Clearly, answering the questions relating to the theory and observational 
imprint of accretion disks and their winds is of wide-ranging significance.


Our team has recently embarked on a project in which a state of the art radiative transfer code, previously
used to model resonance lines in CVs, has been enhanced and improved to be able to model a wider variety of astrophysical
objects and emission mechanisms. The aim of the project is to address the questions identified above, and to try and understand the
full extent to which the disk wind acts as a spectral `filter' in AGN/QSOs, CVs and X-ray binaries.
The near ubiquity of outflowing material in accreting systems also implies a deep connection
between accretion and mass loss, so a natural focal point of our work is to assess
the true extent to which accretion disks follow the so-called `$\alpha$-disk' treatment
outlined by \cite{shakurasunyaev1973}. 
Here I present an eighteen-month transfer report for a PhD project. In section 2, I briefly describe the code, 
and some of the methods we employ. In sections 3 \& 4, I describe some of the work carried out so far. In section 5 I provide a 
plan of remaining work, including a thesis outline, and a short summary.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Method and Approach}

\py is a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code which uses the Sobolev approximation to treat line interactions,
and utilises techniques outlined by Lucy \& collaborators \citep{lucy1993wolfrayet, lucy1999radeq, lucy1999sne}.
To compute the temperature and ionization structure of the wind photons are flown through
a user-defined wind geometry, and Monte Carlo estimators are recorded. The temperature is
then adjusted to balance heating and cooling in the wind. The process is repeated until
the code converges on a solution. Once the ionization and temperature is known, then a spectrum
is obtained by tracking photons through the wind and collecting them in user-specified viewing angle bins.
The code is first introduced by \cite{LK02}, who synthesized the UV spectra of CVs, successfully reproducing P-Cygni resonance line profiles
whilst solving for ionization balance according to the method of \cite{LM93}. \py has since been used with application
to QSO wind modeling \citep{higginbottom2013}, which involved a new ionization scheme to deal with the
more complex power-law spectrum and the inclusion of processes such as Compton scattering in order
to correctly treat X-ray radiation transfer. In addition, \cite{simmacro2005} used \py to model
Hydrogen recombination line profiles in young stellar objects, which involved
implementing a `macro-atom' line transfer mode. 


\subsection{Macro-atoms}

Previously, \py used a two-level atom approximation \cite[see e.g.][]{mihalas}. This approximation is 
fast, and works well when treating so-called `resonance lines' (such as C\textsc{iv}) 
in which the excited electron is strongly coupled to the ground state, but when a level is primarily populated from above then this becomes a poor representation. To reproduce recombination lines, it is therefore
important to use an improved line transfer technique and level population solver.

By quantising matter into `macro-atoms', and radiant and kinetic energy into indivisible energy packets (r- and k- packets respectively), 
Lucy (2002, 2003\nocite{lucy2002, lucy2003}; hereafter L02, L03) showed that it is possible 
to asymptotically reproduce the emisssivity of a gas in statistical equilibrium 
without simplifying the treatment of line transfer. A full description of the scheme 
is well beyond the scope of this report (consult L02, L03), but the `take-home' message is
that the macro-atom scheme does not simplifiy the treatment of line transfer,
with all possible transition paths available from a given level.
While Sim et al. (2005) applied this technique to
a Hydrogen-only model, we are now able to adopt a hybrid scheme. 
Any species in which have their level populations determined by
more complex interactions than resonance transitions
can be treated as full macro-atoms. The other species are treated as so-called `simple-ions',
where they still follow the indivisible packet constraint but are simplified to two level atoms.
This allows one to preserve the fast treatment of resonance lines while providing 
an improved representation of, for example, recombination, which is important when modeling features 
such as the Balmer lines and also recombination {\sl continuum} emission. 

% Hydrogen and Helium both produce
% prominent recombination lines in optical spectra of CVs (see section 3), and so it is important
% to be able to treat them as full

% lines and also the recombination {\sl continuum} which may potentially be responsible for filling in the
% Balmer jump.


\subsection{Code Validation}

\py has previously been tested against a number of radiative transfer and
photoionization codes. Comparisons of ionization balance with \cld \citep{cloudy2013} 
can be found in LK02 and H13 showing excellent agreement. We have also conducted comparisons
of ionization and spectral synthesis with the supernova code \textsc{Tardis.} \tar is described by
\citep{kerzendorfsim}, and the spectral comparisons can be found therein.



In addition to these code validation efforts, I have also conducted tests of
the macro atom scheme in \py to verify that it does indeed solve for level populations correctly
and produces the correct level emissivities. The left panel of figure~\ref{seaton} shows a comparison
between our level emissivities for the Balmer series compared with analytic calculations
by \cite{seaton1959}, showing good agreement in both the Case A and Case B limits 
(see Osterbrock 1989 for a discussion of these two commonly used approximations\nocite{osterbrock}).
The right panel of figure~\ref{seaton} shows a comparison of Helium I level populations (the most
complex ion we currently treat as a macro-atom) between \py and \tar models. Considering the 
two codes use different atomic data and \textsc{Tardis,} unlike \textsc{Python,} currently has a complete treatment of
collisions between radiatively forbidden transitions, the factor of $<2$ agreement is 
encouraging.

\section{The Disk Wind Contribution to the Optical Spectra of Cataclysmic Variables}

Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a donor
star via Roche-lobe overflow. In non-magnetic, disk-dominated systems this accretion
is mediated by an accretion disk which forms around the white dwarf. 
Nova-like (NL) variables are a particular subclass of object in which the accretion disk
is in a permanent state of relatively high accretion rate 
($\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$), making them the perfect laboratories to 
test the $\alpha$-disk model.
For over three decades, it has been known that winds emanating from the accretion disk
are important in shaping the ultraviolet spectra of high-state CVs (Heap 1978), 
the most spectacular evidence being the P-Cygni like profiles of resonance lines such as 
C${\textsc {iv}}$ (see e.g. Cordova \& Mason 1982\nocite{cordova1982}).

While the effect of the wind on the UV is at least partially clear, it may also have more subtle 
effects across the spectral range. It has been proposed that an accretion disk wind
can cause single-peaked emission line profiles in the optical \citep{MC96}, 
such as those seen in nova-like variables and SW Sex stars \citep{HSK86, DR95}.
It is particularly telling that single-peaked lines can be seen even in eclipse, suggesting 
that a spatially extensive wind may be the source of emission (see figure 2).
%%(Honeycutt, Schlegel, \& Kaitchuck 1986; Dhillon \& Rutten 1995). 
Further evidence of the influence of winds in the optical can be seen in P-Cygni like signatures,
observed in lines such as H$\alpha$ and He I $\lambda5876$ \citep{RN98}.
In addition, \cite{KLWB98} suggested
that recombination continuum emission from a disk wind or atmosphere
could be responsible for filling in the Balmer absorption edge. This provided
a potential explanation for
the absence of a pronounced `Balmer jump' in optical spectra of CVs, which has never been adequately produced 
by theoretical models or spectral synthesis.

We took the type of geometries and kinematics used to explain wind 
features in the ultraviolet 
(such as those used by LK02, but see also \citealt{SVM96, noebauer})
and applied our new, hybrid macro-atom radiative transfer scheme. 
The aim was to produce a proof-of-concept: Can these models reproduce some of the 
prominent optical lines, and is the recombination continuum emission
sufficient to mask the Balmer jump?

\subsection{A Biconical Wind CV Model}

We follow LK02 in adopting a biconical wind geometry originally outlined by Schlosman \& Vitello (1993; SV93\nocite{SV93}).
This geometry is shown in figure~\ref{cartoon}. 
A smooth, biconical disk wind rises from the accretion disk between radii $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$. 
The covering fraction of the wind is controlled by the opening angles of the wind, $\theta_{min}$ and 
$\theta_{max}$. As in LK02, we follow the SV93 power law velocity profile.

\subsection{Results}

The synthetic spectrum from a model the same as that described by LK02, but with a slightly more
slowly accelerating wind can be seen in figure 4 (we set the acceleration length, $R_v$ to $7\times10^{11}$~cm). 
We make the prediction that, at high inclinations, the Balmer jump is filled in by recombination continuum emission, and 
we successfully reproduce the Balmer emission lines. In addition, treating Helium as a macro-atom allows 
us to produce strong emission in He~\textsc{I} \& \textsc{II} lines. This can be seen in both the UV (He~\textsc{I} $\lambda1640$)
and the optical (He~\textsc{II} $\lambda4686$, He~\textsc{I} $\lambda4471$, He~\textsc{I} $\lambda4921$ \& others).
The results will be described in detail in a future publication (Matthews et al., in prep).





\section{A Unified QSO Wind Model}

H13 present a benchmark disk wind model
which successfully reproduces some aspects of BALQSO spectra. However, inspection
of the model reveals three key shortcomings. First, the X-ray luminosity of the model
is too weak for non-Bal angles. In addition,
X-rays are attenuated by the disk wind and mean that for BAL angles the luminosity observed
is low for a BALQSO. Second, the model fails to reproduce broad emission lines. 
% The emission measure
% of a plasma of volume V is defined as \citep{kaastra}
% \begin{equation}
% Y=\int^V_0 n_e n_i \,dV
% \end{equation}
% where $n_i$ is the number density of the ion concerned and $n_e$ is the electron density.
It has been proposed that the broad emission seen in QSOs may be caused by collisional excitation \citep{MCGV95},
and currently our model does not produce the predicted amount of collisionally excited line emission. 
Third, the fiducial model fails to correctly model the \la line, because
it uses the two-level atom approximation.
Fortunately, some progress has been made in addressing these three problems.

I have now improved the macro atom mode so that it can also deal
with compton processes using the framework implemented by Nick Higginbottom.
This simply involved adding an extra k-packet destruction channel for Compton 
heating, and k$\rightarrow$r process for Compton cooling. 
It is now also possible to run the code in hybrid macro/simple-ion mode
using the improved ionization scheme presented by H13, and 
we hope that it may produce similar results to the CV case
when modeling the Hydrogen lines in QSOs.

Our team has also discussed some other possible improvements to the code,
which may help provide a more accurate representation of
the plasma conditions in QSO winds. These include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Adapting the ionization scheme to the rate matrix method to provide a more complete treatment for all ions (already used for macro-atoms; see \citealt{kerzendorfsim} for a description of the scheme in an excitation context).
	\item Implementing $\kappa$-distributions of electron energy to model a possible supra-thermal
energy tail caused by X-ray photoionization. It has been claimed that this could enhance collisionally excited line emission from a plasma \citep{HB14}.
	\item Introducing clumping in the wind so as to increase the emission measure. An example implementation is presented by 
	\cite{stalevski2013}.
\end{itemize}

These improvements, coupled with an extensive parameter search and macro-atom treatment, 
will provide insights into how much of the full QSO picture can be explained by a simple biconical disk wind model.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage
\section{Thesis Plan \& Summary}
\label{future}
\noindent Remaining work will be split between a number of projects, forming a thesis with a planned structure as follows:

\bigskip


\noindent {\bf Chapter 1: Introduction.} Context and relevant background. 

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl January 2016}.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Chapter 2: Accretion Disks and Their Winds.} A theoretical and observational overview of the evidence for accretion disk winds, and a review of our current understanding of disk and wind physics. 

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl January 2016}.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Chapter 3: Macro Atoms and Radiative Transfer.} A description of radiative transfer techniques used in \py including an outline of the macro-atom scheme and why it is so important.

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl January 2016}.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Chapter 4: The Disk Wind Contribution to Optical Spectra of Cataclysmic Variables (Project 1)} 

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl June 2014}. 

\noindent {\bf Details:} Some results from this project are shown in Section 3. The broad conclusions are that when a full treatment of recombination is included then the emission from the wind is able to produce strong lines in Hydrogen and Helium, as well as providing 
sufficient continuum emission to mask the Balmer jump at some inclinations.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Chapter 5: A Disk Wind Unification Model for Quasi-Stellar Objects (Project 2)}

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:} {\sl January 2015}.

\noindent {\bf Details:} This project is a natural progression from previous work. Our team 
has already produced a proof-of-concept for the macro atom method in a CV context, and 
also presented a benchmark model for BALQSOs (H13). See section 4 for a description. This project
also provides the opportunity for collaboration with Francesco Shankhar who has identified
a way in which our code could be used in conjunction with his work
on the X-ray and optical properties of BALQSOs (see Morabito et al. 2013\nocite{morabito2013}).

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Science Chapter (Potential): Disk Wind Modeling of X-ray Binaries}

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl October 2015}.

\noindent {\bf Details:} P-Cygni line profiles in CIV have been observed in X-ray binaries,
offerring a tantalising hint of outflowing material \citep{ioannau2003}. I am a Co-I on the HST proposal 13630 which involves taking UV observations of the `missing-link' pulsar PSR J1023+0038, designed to assess the state of the wind when the system is in the accreting 
X-ray binary state (as is reported by \citealt{Patruno2014}). An example snapshot of the HST spectrum is shown in Figure 5, where a number of broad
emission lines can be seen.
At the moment it is not clear whether wind features are present, but modeling the system may still
provide an intriguing insight 
into the amount of mass loss and potential effects on the accretion disk, and would also
allow us to constrain the wind geometry, if a wind exists. Even a wider-ranging, proof-of-concept investigation into
X-ray binary geometries would prove informative in both this context and more generally, using the groundwork
on X-ray systems in our code carried out by H13. This project offers the opportunity 
for collaboration with the Co-Is on proposal 13630: Diego Altamarino, Rene Breton
and Juan Hernandez Santisteban.

the O\textsc{i} and Ly$\alpha$ lines are enhanced by geocoronal emission, but the broad wings of these lines
are probably intrinsic to the system.

\end{figure}

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Science Chapter (Potential): Reverberation Modeling of Active Galactic Nuclei}

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:} {\sl October 2015}.

\noindent {\bf Details:} Reverberation mapping is an important technique in understanding 
the geometry of AGN systems \citep{peterson1998}. Incorporating predictions for reverberation mapping
into our code is relatively straightforward: one simply has to track each individual 
photon's path length and origin as they travel through the wind. Once this is carried out,
predictions for reverberation responses can be made for various wind geometries, and a direct comparison
to reverberation mapping data will yield informative results and provide a well-defined project.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Chapter 7: Conclusions.} A summary of the work carried out and its implications for the field. 

\noindent {\bf Planned Completion Date:}  {\sl January 2016}.

\bigskip

\subsection{Summary}
\noindent {\sl At a bare minimum}, I believe projects 1 \& 2 would provide sufficient 
original research to constitute a thesis, providing that project 2 involved significant development
of the benchmark H13 model and produced the anticipated high-impact work. 
However, given the time available, it is feasible that {\sl at least} one of the remaining projects 
will be completed in time for the final thesis. The choice of project undertaken will depend on a number of factors:

\begin{itemize}
 	\item The conclusions we can draw from the data from HST proposal 13630, and the implications for 
 	      modeling of X-ray binary winds.
 	\item The ability of our model to produce BELs, as this impacts whether including reverberation mapping is
 	      possible, and indeed relevant.
 	\item The success of project 2 and the number of separate papers that come out of the study. 
 \end{itemize} 

A combination of the above projects represents a robust thesis plan.
The PhD will involve the application of Monte Carlo techniques to a number of different types of system, 
with the theme of unification and universality providing a scientific link between projects which 
 cover systems with masses ranging from one, to billions, of solar masses.
